# Dakota Orrock's Project 1 Readme
## The Scriptures, Mapped

### What did I learn (HW #5)
- I was not aware of the HTML 5 Boiler Plate template. It was cool to see that I could use that to skip alot of the project setup.
- I learned that I dont need JQuery to make an Ajax call, wild. 
- I learned the importance of having an organized DB, with how you set up the books and volumes tables it made it very easy to loop through the data and assign and populate a books array to each volumes object.
- I also learned how to writh in Markdown, let me know how I am doing. 
- I really liked the set up (commented code) for the scriptures.js file, that made the file very readable.

### Big Takeaways
- The biggest take away that I had was how important it is to have a readable file (I am refering mainly to scriptures.js)
- I really liked the html helpers, that is something that I have never done when adding html through JS functions. It was a nice and covienient way to scaffold and add html.
- I really learned to appreciate the debugger in the console, I had never really used it before (just console.log) and this helped me find the bugs in my code much easier and faster.
