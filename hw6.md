### What did I learn (HW #6)
- Fetch API
  - I learned how convienient .then chaining can be.
  - This API made the AJAX function a lot simple and easier to read.
- Comparing my code to the solution.zip
  - I like how there is a maplabel.js file. It made me realize that I could have spent more time making my google map labels more readable.
  - In my add marker function I should have compared my existing lat and lng coordinates to the coordinates to add by comparing the difference of the two to a delta and not by using the '===' operator.
  - I think I could have simplified my addLabel function by splitting it up into more functions.
  - I was not dividing my viewAltitude by a ZOOM_RATIO, so the maps were zooming in too much.
  - I built my showLocation function outside of my scriptures object and I should have built it inside, returned it, then assigned a varible to scriptures.showLocation to make my code cleaner.
  - I could have implemented breadcrumbs
  - Although there are parts of my code that are very different, I think that I found acceptable solutions overall. I think that I definately could have made more functions to break up some of my longer funcitons.
